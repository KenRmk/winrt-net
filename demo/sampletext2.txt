My name is Oliver Queen. For five years I was stranded on an island with only one goal: survive. Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish. To use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become... something else.
My name is Oliver Queen. After five years on a hellish island, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was. To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else. I must be... something else.
My name is Oliver Queen. After five years in hell, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. Now others have joined my crusade. To them I'm Oliver Queen. To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else. I am... something else.
My name was Oliver Queen. For three years I worked to save my city, but to save my sister I had to become someone else. I had to become... something else.

My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me, and one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am the Flash!

My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible, and I became The Flash. I used my powers to find the man responsible for my mother's death. I thought I would finally get justice for my family, but I failed. It's been six months since the singularity, I'm on my own now. Decided it's better that way, it keeps the people I care about safe. There's only one thing I can do now. I run.

In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child. I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power. Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to, the Time Masters. In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.

To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother but in doing so I opened up our world to new threats and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am the Flash!
My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible, and I became The Flash. I used my powers to find the man responsible for my mother's death. I thought I would finally get justice for my family, but I failed. It's been six months since the singularity, I'm on my own now. Decided it's better that way, it keeps the people I care about safe. There's only one thing I can do now. I run.

In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child. I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power. Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to, the Time Masters. In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.

My name is Oliver Queen. For five years I was stranded on an island with only one goal: survive. Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish. To use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become... something else.
My name is Oliver Queen. After five years on a hellish island, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was. To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else. I must be... something else.

My name is Oliver Queen. After five years in hell, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. Now others have joined my crusade. To them I'm Oliver Queen. To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else. I am... something else.
My name was Oliver Queen. For three years I worked to save my city, but to save my sister I had to become someone else. I had to become... something else.

My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me, and one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am the Flash!

My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible, and I became The Flash. I used my powers to find the man responsible for my mother's death. I thought I would finally get justice for my family, but I failed. It's been six months since the singularity, I'm on my own now. Decided it's better that way, it keeps the people I care about safe. There's only one thing I can do now. I run.

In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child. I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power. Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to, the Time Masters. In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.

To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother but in doing so I opened up our world to new threats and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am the Flash!
My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible, and I became The Flash. I used my powers to find the man responsible for my mother's death. I thought I would finally get justice for my family, but I failed. It's been six months since the singularity, I'm on my own now. Decided it's better that way, it keeps the people I care about safe. There's only one thing I can do now. I run.

In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child. I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power. Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to, the Time Masters. In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.

My name is Oliver Queen. For five years I was stranded on an island with only one goal: survive. Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish. To use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become... something else.
My name is Oliver Queen. After five years on a hellish island, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was. To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else. I must be... something else.

My name is Oliver Queen. After five years in hell, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. Now others have joined my crusade. To them I'm Oliver Queen. To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else. I am... something else.
My name was Oliver Queen. For three years I worked to save my city, but to save my sister I had to become someone else. I had to become... something else.

My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me, and one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am the Flash!

My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother but in doing so I opened up our world to new threats and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am the Flash!
My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible, my father went to prison for her murder, then an accident made me the impossible, and I became The Flash. I used my powers to find the man responsible for my mother's death. I thought I would finally get justice for my family, but I failed. It's been six months since the singularity, I'm on my own now. Decided it's better that way, it keeps the people I care about safe. There's only one thing I can do now. I run.

In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child. I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power. Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to, the Time Masters. In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.
